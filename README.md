# Zendesk User Unsuspend Service

Automatically checks and unsuspends Zendesk users by email address. Perfect for noreply email addresses that get auto-suspended.

## Features

- üîç Search users by email address
- üîì Automatically unsuspend suspended users
- üìä Detailed logging and summary reports
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Easy deployment to Railway
- ‚è∞ Can be scheduled with Railway Cron

## Setup

### 1. Get Zendesk API Credentials

1. Log into your Zendesk account as an admin
2. Go to Admin Center ‚Üí Apps and integrations ‚Üí APIs ‚Üí Zendesk API
3. Enable Token Access
4. Click "Add API token"
5. Copy the token (you won't see it again!)

### 2. Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your credentials
# ZENDESK_SUBDOMAIN=your-company (from your-company.zendesk.com)
# ZENDESK_EMAIL=admin@yourcompany.com
# ZENDESK_API_TOKEN=your-token-here
# NOREPLY_EMAILS=noreply@example.com,no-reply@example.com

# Run the script
npm start
```

### 3. Deploy to Railway

1. **Create a new project in Railway**
   - Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Click "New Project" ‚Üí "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Connect this repository

2. **Add Environment Variables**
   - In Railway project settings, go to "Variables"
   - Add all variables from `.env.example`:
     - `ZENDESK_SUBDOMAIN`
     - `ZENDESK_EMAIL`
     - `ZENDESK_API_TOKEN`
     - `NOREPLY_EMAILS`

3. **Configure the service**
   - Railway will auto-detect Node.js and run `npm start`
   - The service will run once when deployed

4. **Schedule it (Optional)**
   - To run this regularly, use Railway's Cron Jobs
   - Create a Cron service in Railway
   - Set schedule (e.g., `0 */6 * * *` for every 6 hours)
   - Command: `npm start`

## How It Works

1. Reads email addresses from `NOREPLY_EMAILS` environment variable
2. For each email:
   - Searches for the user in Zendesk
   - Checks if they're suspended
   - Unsuspends them if needed
3. Outputs a summary report

## Example Output

```
üìß Processing 3 email address(es)...

Checking user: noreply@example.com
‚úì Found user: No Reply (ID: 12345)
‚ö† User is suspended. Unsuspending...
‚úì Successfully unsuspended: noreply@example.com

Checking user: notifications@example.com
‚úì Found user: Notifications (ID: 67890)
‚úì User is already active: notifications@example.com

üìä Summary:
Total processed: 3
Unsuspended: 1
Already active: 1
Not found: 0
Errors: 0
```

## Customization

### Add More Emails

Edit the `NOREPLY_EMAILS` environment variable:
```
NOREPLY_EMAILS=noreply@domain.com,no-reply@domain.com,alerts@domain.com,system@domain.com
```

### Run on a Schedule

With Railway Cron or any cron service:
```
# Every 6 hours
0 */6 * * *

# Daily at 3 AM
0 3 * * *

# Every hour
0 * * * *
```

## Troubleshooting

### "User not found"
- Verify the email address is correct
- Check if the user exists in Zendesk

### "Authentication failed"
- Verify your Zendesk subdomain
- Check your API token is correct
- Ensure the API user has admin permissions

### "Rate limit exceeded"
- Zendesk API has rate limits
- Add delays between requests if processing many users
- Consider running less frequently

## Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file
- Keep your API token secure
- Use Railway's encrypted environment variables
- Regularly rotate API tokens
